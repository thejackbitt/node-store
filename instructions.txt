In this activity, you are managing an online store. To do this, you will need three Classes:

  Store     - for the Store itself 
  Product   - for each type of product sold 
  Customer  - for the customers who place orders 

The Store class should have these properties:

  name                  the name of the store
  opens                 what time the store opens
  closes                what time the store closes 
  inventory = []        an array of products available in the store
  shoppersClub = [];    an array of customers who order stuff 

and these methods:

  displayWelcome()      console.logs a welcome message w/ name of the store
  areYouOpen(hour)      if the hour passed in is between the open time and the close time, 
                        return true; otherwise false 
  addProduct(prod)      adds the product object passed in to the store inventory 
  addShopper(shopper)   adds a customer object passed in to the shoppers club array


The Product class will have these properties:

  name
  price
  qty

and these methods:

  reduceQty()         subtracts 1 from the qty for that product
  givePrice()         returns the price for that product  


The Customer class will have these properties:

  name                name of the customer
  productsPurchased   an array of products purchased by this customer 
  amountSpent         total dollar amount spent by this customer 

and this method:

  buyProduct(store, product)      accepts a store object and a product object.
                                  adds the product object to the productsPurchased array 
                                  reduces the qty of the product by one 
                                  adds the price of the product to the amount spent by the user
